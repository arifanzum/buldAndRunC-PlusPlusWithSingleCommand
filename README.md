# buldAndRunC-WithSingleCommand

 often face a problem where to build and run a c++ program I have to use two different commands which makes my workflow slow. and in the game of competitive programming time is everything so I am writing this simple bash script to do it in a single command.

you just type cpprun <file_name> [without extension]

put the script in your bin folder /bin 

run the command chmod +x cpprun

you are ready to use it.
